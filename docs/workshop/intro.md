# Workshop

## 👨‍💻 How will we work?

A sample project has been created for you. You will be able to clone it from GitHub in order to be able to start right ahead. The complete project structure as well as some part of the code are already included in it.

This workshop is not about learning React and React Native. The goal is for you to understand how a React Native application is built and be able to see it get from the sample project to the expected app.

> **No deep Javascript/React/React Native is required (but it is of course a plus).**

The workshop guide will provide you clear instructions regarding where and what code should be placed. Some explanation of interesting lines will also be given in order to make you grasp the concepts behind what we are building.

## 📑 Clone the project

The sample project can be found on GitHub:

[`https://github.com/dafooz/simple-weather`](https://github.com/dafooz/simple-weather)

Go ahead with your favorite graphical client (SourceTree, Fork,... ) or command line and clone it!

>Note that the project has 2 branches:
>
> - `workshop` (this is the branch you should checkout for this workshop)
> - `final` (this branch contains the fully working app that you will build during the workshop).

## 📖 The steps

In order to end up with a fully functional application, we will go through the following steps:

1. [Introduction](./guide/guide_1.md)
2. [Current state of our project](./guide/guide_2.md)
3. [Adding some components in the application](./guide/guide_3.md)
4. [Scaffolding our application](./guide/guide_4.md)
5. [Adding content in the different components](./guide/guide_5.md)
6. [Adding user interaction](./guide/guide_6.md)

## 🏃‍♂️ Let's get started!
