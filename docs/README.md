# Simple Weather App

## An introduction to React native

### Before the workshop...

A little work to make sure you have everything ready before the workshop starts is required:

1. [Get access to the Weather API](./openweather.md)
2. [Get your laptop ready for creating the app](./prerequisites.md)

### During the workshop...

After a high level introduction to React Native, and presenting the differences between React Native, Flutter, ... we will create a small weather app to practice some of the basic concepts of React Native.

The final app will look like this:

<div width="100%" style="display: flex; justify-content: center"><img src='./assets/appscreen-1.png' height="500"/></div>
