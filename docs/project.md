## Get the project running

### 1. Checkout the github project
Using your favorite Git client (or terminal) clone the following repository in you desired folder

```
git@github.com:dafooz/simple-weather.git
```

You can checkout the master branch of this repository as we will work based on that master branch.

### 2. Install the project dependencies
In order to download the dependencies, we will use the 

```
yarn
``` 
command. Go ahead and run it 😉.

### 3. Get expo running

Almost there! Now everything is ready to see the magic happen on your device 👍! 

Simply run

```
expo start
```

and this will kick off the build of the project. We also have something very handy: Live refresh so once the app is running you will see the changes as you code.

It will also launch a web page showing you the bundler, sort of console output of what's happening in your app. You will also find there shortcut to launch the app on an emulated device as well as a QR code that you can scan with the expo client on your device to launch the app. 

> 📝 This last step is not necessary in the client if you used the same expo account on your laptop and your device. The project will automatically be listed in the Projects tab.
